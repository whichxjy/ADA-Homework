# Couples

## Description

N couples are standing in a circle, numbered consecutively clockwise from 1 to 2N. Husband and wife do not always stand together. We remove the couples who stand together until the circle is empty or we can't remove a couple any more.

Can we remove all the couples out of the circle?

## Input

There may be several test cases in the input file. In each case, the first line is an integer N(1 <= N <= 100000)----the number of couples. In the following N lines, each line contains two integers ---- the numbers of each couple.

N = 0 indicates the end of the input.

## Output

Output "Yes" if we can remove all the couples out of the circle. Otherwise, output "No".
