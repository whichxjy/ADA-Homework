# Greatest Common Divisors

## Description

A common divisor for two positive numbers is a number which both numbers are divisible by. It's easy to calculate the greatest common divisor between tow numbers. But your teacher wants to give you a harder task, in this task you have to find the greatest common divisor d between two integers a and b that is in a given range from low to high (inclusive), i.e. low<=d<=high. It is possible that there is no common divisor in the given range.

## Input

The first line contains an integer T (1<=T<=10)- indicating the number of test cases.

For each case, there are four integers a, b, low, high (1<=a,b<=1000,1<=low<=high<=1000) in one line.

## Output

For each case, print the greatest common divisor between a and b in given range, if there is no common divisor in given range, you should print “No answer”(without quotes).

## Sample Input

```

9 27 1 5
9 27 10 11
9 27 9 11
```

## Sample Output
