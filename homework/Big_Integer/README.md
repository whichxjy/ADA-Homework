# Big Integer

## Description

Long long ago, there was a super computer that could deal with VeryLongIntegers(no VeryLongInteger will be negative). Do you know how this computer stores the VeryLongIntegers? This computer has a set of n positive integers: b1,b2,...,bn, which is called a basis for the computer.

The basis satisfies two properties:

1) 1 < bi <= 1000 (1 <= i <= n),

2) gcd(bi,bj) = 1 (1 <= i,j <= n, i â‰  j).

Let M = b1 * b2 * ... * bn

Given an integer x, which is nonegative and less than M, the ordered n-tuples (x mod b1, x mod b2, ..., x mod bn), which is called the representation of x, will be put into the computer.

## Input

The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T) is given in the first line of the input.

Each test case contains three lines.

The first line contains an integer n(<=100).

The second line contains n integers: b1,b2,...,bn, which is the basis of the computer.

The third line contains a single VeryLongInteger x.

Each VeryLongInteger will be 400 or fewer characters in length, and will only contain digits (no VeryLongInteger will be negative).

## Output

For each test case, print exactly one line -- the representation of x.

The output format is:(r1,r2,...,rn)
