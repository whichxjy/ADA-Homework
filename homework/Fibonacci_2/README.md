# Fibonacci 2

## Description

In the Fibonacci integer sequence, F0 = 0, F1 = 1, and Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for n ≥ 2. For example, the first ten terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

Given an integer n, your goal is to compute the last Fn mod (10^9 + 7).

## Input

The input test file will contain a single line containing n **(n ≤ 2^31-1)**.

There are multiple test cases!

## Output

For each test case, print the Fn mod (10^9 + 7).

## Sample Input

9

## Sample Output

34

## Hint

You may need to use "long long".
