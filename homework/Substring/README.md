# Substring

## Description

Dr lee cuts a string S into N pieces, s[1], …, s[N].   

Now, Dr lee gives you these N sub-strings: s[1], …, s[N]. There might be several possibilities that the string S could be. For example, if Dr. lee gives you three sub-strings {"a", "ab", "ac"}, the string S could be "aabac", "aacab", "abaac", …   

Your task is to output the lexicographically smallest S. 

## Input

The first line of the input is a positive integer T. T is the number of the test cases followed.   

The first line of each test case is a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 8) which represents the number of sub-strings. After that, N lines followed. The i-th line is the i-th sub-string s[i]. Assume that the length of each sub-string is positive and less than 100. 

## Output

The output of each test is the lexicographically smallest S. No redundant spaces are needed. 

## Sample Input

```
1
3
a
ab
ac
```

## Sample Output

```
aabac
```
